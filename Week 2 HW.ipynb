    "    Second Extension: You introduced character-specific Markov chains, where each character in a dataset has their own unique model for word transitions. This allows the chatbot to generate personalized text that reflects each character’s speech patterns. We also discussed how to improve and extend the sentence generation function to work with this character-based structure.\n",

    "1.  Chatgpt's ability to understand advanced concepts like Monty Hall problem and Markovian Chain code is suprisingly adept.\n",
